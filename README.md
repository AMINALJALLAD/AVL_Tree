# AVL_Tree
#This is a visual representation of the avl tree that shows you what actually happens when you add or delete a node to the tree
#you can see all the steps by adding extra boolean parameter that allows you to see at any point the state of the tree
# I add a generic form of this tree, so you can sort any class of your defintion by utilising the avl tree ( very important to follow the recommendation 
    # in the filrst line of the to get the results that you expect )

# Have a fun
